Data Structure Library
----------------------

   This library implements a number of data structures.  At this point,
   this library is pretty much just a stub and will hopefully grow in the
   future to a comprehensive collection of data structures.  Contributions
   are welcome!

      This directory contains the implementation details of the library.

   detail/ml/$(SML_COMPILER)/

      These directories (e.g. detail/ml/mlton/) contain compiler specific
      implementation details.
