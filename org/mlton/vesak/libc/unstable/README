LibC MLNLFFI Interface
----------------------

   This library provides a MLNLFFI interface to (some portions of) the C
   standard library (libc).

About Library Organization
--------------------------

   Makefile

      This is a GNU makefile for building the library.  It is designed to
      allow a single source tree to be built on multiple platforms.  Run
      the command

         make

      to see a list of supported targets.

   libc-nlffi-$(TARGET_ARCH)-$(TARGET_OS).a

      This library contains the C compiled part of the libc interface.
      You need to link your program against this library.  The variables
      TARGET_ARCH and TARGET_OS refer to the corresponding variables as
      defined by the compiler.  For example, with the mlton compiler
      running the command

         mlton -show-path-map true | grep TARGET

      shows the variables.

   public/

      This directory contains the public header files used as source files
      to mlnlffigen.

   libc.mlb

      This the MLB-file for the SML part of the libc interface.

   detail/

      This directory contains the implementation details of the library.


About Motivation and Scope
--------------------------

   The main motivation of this library is to make it easier to implement
   bindings to C libraries.  This library should eventually include all
   parts of libc that make sense from that perspective.
