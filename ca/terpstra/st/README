This is a simple work-alike of state-threads.sf.net for Standard ML.
It helps in building event driven state machines with non-concurrent threads.

For an example, see test.sml

To use on osx:
	make kevent/kevent.mlb
	mlton test.mlb

To use on linux:
	edit st.mlb to use epoll.mlb instead of kevent.mlb
	make epoll/epoll.mlb
	mlton test.mlb

The test program downloads two webpages from google concurrently, while
answering TCP connections on port 12467 and printing a heart beat.
