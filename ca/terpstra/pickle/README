Since MLton has no automatic serialization capability, this attempts to
build one as a library. The idea was that a protocol could be specified as
a SML type and the compiled into a serializer for C and SML.

The serializers are built as functors. This way they can be instantiated on
a binary or text serializer for basic types.

Compile the compiler with:
	make
The test directory includes example SML types suitable for compilation
