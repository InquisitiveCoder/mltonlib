This directory contains source to code to bind the SQLite3 library to SML.

   http://www.sqlite.org/  -- The SQLite project
   http://www.mlton.org/   -- The Standard ML (SML) compiler targeted

To compile the project, first compile SQLite and install the sqlite3 library
into the default search path for your system. Also install mlton. Create
a .mlb file for your project that lists sqlite.mlb, example: demo.mlb.

To compile:

   mlton -link-opt "-lsqlite3" your-project.mlb

The complete interface to the library is covered in sql.sig. See demo.sml
for example code that creates SQL functions and queries.
