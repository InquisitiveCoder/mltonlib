(**
 * Signature for a generic datatype recursion analysis.
 *
 * In Standard ML, cyclic data structures, ignoring closures, can only be
 * implemented through mutable types, references and arrays.  Furthermore,
 * a mutable type can only be used to form cycles if it is a part of a
 * strongly connected component containing a recursive datatype or
 * contains an exception.  This makes it possible to compute a simple
 * conservative approximation as to whether a given mutable type can be
 * part of cycle.
 *
 * These type properties can be useful for both optimizations and for
 * ensuring correctness.  As an optimization one could, for example,
 * determine whether one needs to handle cyclic values (which can be
 * costly) or not.
 *
 * This generic value is unlikely to be directly useful in application
 * programs and is more likely to be used internally in the implementation
 * of some other generics (e.g. pickling).
