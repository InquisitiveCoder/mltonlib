(**
 * Signature for a structural equality predicate.
 *
 * By default, the semantics of the predicate corresponds to the equality
 * relation that can be achieved through pickling and unpickling.  While
 * the identities of mutable objects need not be equal, it is required that
 * there is a one-to-one correspondence between the identities of the
 * mutable objects of the compared values.
 *
 * This equality predicate is unlikely to be useful in most applications.
 * However, this is useful for testing the correctness of pickling and
 * other similar generics.
