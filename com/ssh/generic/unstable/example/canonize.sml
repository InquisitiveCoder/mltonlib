open Generic

(**
 * This is a simple example of using the {Reduce} and {Transform}
 * generics.  The program reads a term given as an argument and shows the
 * canonized version of the term.  Canonization renames bindings so that
 * alpha equivalent terms have the same representation.
 *)

(* The {Lambda} module defines the representation of the terms of our toy
 * language.  Identifiers are just strings.  Crucial to the use of the
 * {Reduce} and {Transform} generics is that the terms of the language are
 * defined as a fixed point of a functor, {f}.  This allows the {Reduce}
 * and {Transform} generics to operate on all the subterms of a given
 * term.
 *
 * The commented ellipsis in the definition of the term functor suggests
 * that one could add further variants to the term.  Doing so means that
 * the functor type representation would also need to be changed.
 * However, unless new binding or variable reference forms are added,
 * other definitions would not need to be changed. *)
