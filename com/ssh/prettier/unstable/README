Pretty-Printing Library
-----------------------

   This library provides a pretty-printing library.  The design is
   primarily based on Philip Wadler's article ``A prettier printer''
 
      [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/language-design.html]
 
   which is a redesign of John Hughes's pretty-printing library described
   in ``The Design of a Pretty-Printing Library''
 
      [http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/pretty.html]
 
   Some of Daan Leijen's PPrint library
 
      [http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/pprint.html]
 
   has also been implemented.
